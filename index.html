  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in computer systems. It involves creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, reasoning, perception, and decision-making. AI technologies aim to mimic cognitive functions, enabling machines to process and analyze data, adapt to new situations, and improve their performance over time.</p>
